Today was quite a nice day actually. It was pretty warm and the weather was not too bad. It was a little windy, however, and even though it was sunny for most of the day, it was not sunny for the entire day. I hope the weather improves throughout the rest of the week. Unfortunately, it is likely that the days will simply get colder as time passes.
